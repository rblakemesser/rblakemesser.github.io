Once upon a time, in the early, hazy days of our relationship, Blake traveled across the country to see Kendra where, in a fit of passion, we watched critically acclaimed documentary 'Jiro Dreams of Sushi.' (Come on. Like you somehow got to this page *without* knowing we're huge nerds.) Since then, we have been dreaming of going to Japan -- and now, for our honeymoon, we're making the dream come true!

We would be honored if you would help send us on our way by buying us a date or treat (train tickets to see the countryside, a meditative trip to a traditional bathhouse, candy shaped like a toilet from a bizarre Tokyo vending machine) via our honeymoon registry.
