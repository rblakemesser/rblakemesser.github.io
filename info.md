Please join us in our backyard at 4 p.m. on Saturday, April 7, 2018. We'll get married! You'll be there! It will be a really good time.

**What to wear**
However makes you happiest. For real. Please put on the outfit that makes you feel like your best and most attractive self. If this is a tux, fantastic; if it's a favorite pair of bluejeans, equally fantastic! (Just, like, don't wear a wedding dress or whatever; that would be rude.)

## Where to park
Our neighborhood has a bounty of street parking! It is free and luscious. Please be courteous of our neighbors; they are nice and we like them.

## Where to stay
We strongly recommend you eschew the hotels and get an AirBnBb in a fun Austin neighborhood! You can hit a similar price point for a much more buy-local, Keep It Weird experience. If you'd like to be near us and our venue, look in the Bouldin Creek, Travis Heights and Dawson neighborhoods.

## How to get around town
If you're coming in from out of town and don't want to rent a car, you're in luck: after a brief hiatus, rideshare programs like Lyft are back in Austin! If you don't have the app on your phone already, download it before you arrive, or buddy up to someone else who has. 

(We recommend Lyft over Uber, if only because they are 1. functionally identical, and 2. slightly less apparently evil than Uber.) (Man, Uber really leans into the evil.)

## What amazing things to do in Austin
Are you coming in early or staying a bit later? EXCELLENT CHOICE! We live in a phenomenally fun city. Here are some suggestions (via Kendra) of things you might like to do, eat and see to enjoy the heck out of your stay in Austin:

### Food
#### Tacos 
The perpetual tourist favorite is **Torchy's**. It's a bit of an Austin legend-began as a food truck but now has locations all over town. I personally feel a little underwhelmed by their taco selection now, but their queso is unmissable. Treat yo'self.

The actual best tacos in the city: go to the **Veracruz al Natural** truck at **Radio Coffee** on South Lamar. If you'll permit me to hand-hold you a bit here: order the migas or migas poblanas tacos on corn tortillas. Dress them with the molcajete (brown) salsa. You will have no regrets. Unless you do not go get these tacos. Then you will have regrets forever. Trust me. (Radio's a great coffee/beer place, so cruise in there and grab drinks while you wait -- you pay for Veracruz's excellence with slowness, especially on weekends.)

#### Not tacos (aka, other food)
Do you love ramen? Go to **Ramen Tatsuya** on South Lamar. Be prepared to stand in a line, but it moves quickly. Everything here is amazing; I recommend getting the sweet & sour yodas appetizer while you wait and adding an ajitama (marinated soft-boiled egg) to any ramen bowl. 

For the experience, check out **Gordough's Public House**, also on South Lamar. It started as a doughnut truck and is now a doughnut restaurant. The burgers come between two doughnuts. The salads come with a garlic doughnut. It's extravagant and extreme and worth doing once in your life. (http://gourdoughs.com/)

If you want to drop some money on some exquisite small plates (because whatever; you're on vacation), try **Uchi**, the Japanese fusion place on South Lamar (doesn't take reservations; you just go wait a little bit) or **Lenoir** (French, South 1st). For midscale, check out **Sway** right down the street (family-style Thai)

For pizza, go to **Homeslice** on South Congress and get the fried eggplant pie. Think you don't like eggplant? Think you'd prefer pepperoni? Too bad. Get this pie. You'll thank me later.

#### Baked goods
**Quacks**, in Hyde Park, is the bakery of my heart, and I wrote most of my first book there. They're also doing our wedding cake, so if you have a slice and get hooked, go check them out. Try a piece of key lime pie, and maybe also wander next door to **Julio's** for a big Tex Mex breakfast plate (heads up, they're cash only.)

### Dranks:
**Midnight Cowboy** is a really, really lovely speakeasy tucked away on 6th Street. It's not inexpensive (cocktails are $12 across the board), but the atmosphere is phenomental and the drinks are superb -- all old-fashioned affairs made with absinthe and aperol and chartreuse and lavender-infused whatsits. This is an even better experience if you don't tell your partner or friends where you're taking them. To get here, go to 6th Street across from the Alamo Ritz (you can Google Maps it, but it's easy to miss even then). You'll spot a battered-looking door with a rusty metal grating and a row of apartment buzzers beside it (a red lightbulb may be illuminated just over the door). Ring the buzzer for "Harry Craddock" for entry. You do need to make reservations to go; make them here: (http://midnightcowboymodeling.com/)

(If you can't get reservations and still want a speakeasy experience, **Firehouse** is lots of fun; you enter through a sliding bookcase: (http://www.firehousehostel.com/) )

### Goin' out
If you are younger/hipper/cooler than I am and like to party hardy, **6th Street** and **Rainey Street** are the places to go get your drink on. People who are not me have lots and lots of fun here. You are not me. Perhaps this is for you! (A bit of geography: "Dirty 6th" is the stretch of 6th Street between Congress and I-35, generally plastered with vomit and stray pizza slices by 2 a.m.) For a chiller vibe, I highly recommend crossing the highway to east 6th. Look for **Rio Rita's** (very groovy lounge/drink space), go two-stepping at **The White Horse,** or, further afield, get drinks at **Lustre Pearl** (an old New Orleans house relocated to Austin and turned bar).

There's also the **Red River District**, home to gay/everyone bar **Cheer Up Charlie's** and big music venues **The Mohawk** and **Stubb's**, walking distance from all of these locations. For very, very good dancing, you'll want to hit up Barbarella's, whose Tuesgayz dance nights on Tuesdays are legendary.

For more gay bars, check out **4th Street,** home to **Rain** and **The Highland Lounge.**

### Wandering and sightseeing
If you've got an hour to kill and want to "experience" Austin, accept that the Lonely Planet guide is right and wander around the carnival-esque shops, restaurants and music scene on **South Congress**. Take a photo with the iconic "i love you so much" street art, get ice cream at **Amy's**, marvel at the oddities of **Uncommon Objects** and the amazing, immersive costume shop **Lucy in Disguise**.

If you're downtown, visit our brand new **Central Library** -- it's stunning! (Of COURSE I'm going to tell you to go to a library.) Afterward, wander past super hip toy store **Toy Joy** and then go get hot cocoa cocktails and make-your-own-s'mores-at-the-table at **Halcyon**.

If you want some nature, consider renting a kayak (lots of places do this and they're all great!) to paddle the river. The **Congress Avenue bridge bats** usually appear later in the year, but you may get lucky! Paddle at dusk for your chance to see this cloud of millions of bats emerge to feed. For day nature, check out one of Austin's many **greenbelt trails** or **hike and bike trail** along the river.
